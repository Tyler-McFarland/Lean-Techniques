# Lean-Techniques
Code assessment for Lean Techniques.  It is a console application that consumes a prebuid web service.  The web service returns JSON values so I use newtonsoft with C# to create dynamic JSON objects and print to console. To run the program go to https://github.com/Tyler-McFarland/Lean-Techniques and select the download the zip option.  Once that is downloaded unzip the folder and it is available to run in either visual studio or you can go to C:\Users\mcfar\OneDrive\Documents\Fall 2019\LeanTechniques\LeanTechniques\bin\Debug and double click on LeanTechniques.exe.  You have to download the whole project folder since I used Newtonsoft to parse the JSON.  IF YOU TRY TO JUST RUN THE EXE BY ITSELF FROM GITHUB IT WONT WORK YOU NEED THE WHOLE PROJECT FOLDER!
