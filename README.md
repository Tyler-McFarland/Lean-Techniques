# Lean-Techniques
Code assessment for Lean Techniques.  It is a console application that consumes a prebuid web service.  The web service returns JSON values so I use newtonsoft with C# to create dynamic JSON objects and print to console. To run the program go to https://github.com/Tyler-McFarland/Lean-Techniques/blob/master/LeanTechniques/LeanTechniques/bin/Debug/LeanTechniques.exe and download the exe.  Once you have it downloaded you can run it on anyone's machine.  Enter an Id number of 1-100 and it will list the titles associated with that Id.  Once it is finished running you can scroll though the outputs.  Once you hit enter it will shutdown the program.
