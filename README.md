# Lean-Techniques
Code assessment for Lean Techniques.  It is a console application that consumes a prebuid web service.  The web service returns JSON values so I use newtonsoft to deserialize the json into a prebuilt object. To run the program go to https://github.com/Tyler-McFarland/Lean-Techniques and select the download the zip option.  Once that is downloaded unzip the folder and it is available to run in either visual studio or you can go to C:\Users\mcfar\OneDrive\Documents\Fall 2019\LeanTechniques\LeanTechniques\bin\Debug and double click on LeanTechniques.exe.  You have to download the whole project folder since I used Newtonsoft to parse the JSON.  I know the feedback said that typically the packages weren't added to github I just want to make sure that everyone can run it no matter where they are.  I also did look into MOQ unit testing it just didn't really seem like it was going to help me in this scenario.  To my understanding it looks more like it's testing http requests and I have one in this program just grabbing the json.  Thank you guys for the feedback it has definitely made me change some of my coding habits.  Hope to hear from you again soon!
